# CSS Layout

## Getting things in the right place

This is one of the hardest things in CSS so let's quickly cover a **little** bit of theory.

## Flow Layout

CSS has 7 distinct layout modes. You will already have heard of some of them. Like Flexbox (technically flexible box layout) and Grid.

The default is "Normal Flow" aka Flow Layout. Flow layout is based on `inline` elements and `block` elements. Inline elements display one after the other, starting on the left, and block elements start at the top and move down the page. 

If you think about a newspaper this makes sense. Block elements are like paragraphs that are stacked on top of each other. Inline elements like `<strong>` do not stack. They just sit in the flow of the text from left to right. By default, most elements are `block`.

The significant exception is `<button>`. Buttons are inline elements but if you were to give it a margin-top, it would take effect, unlike a `span`. Weird!

Block elements like `h1` and `p` and `div` will expand to fill the available space.

## Flex Layout

The default flow layout is great for the original purpose of HTML & CSS - namely laying documents out a bit like a newspaper. 

However, as the web has developed, user interfaces have become increasingly complex. Probably the best and easiest approach to layout is the `flex layout` (A.K.A Flexbox).
